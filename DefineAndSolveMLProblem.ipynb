These include using Pandas to apply data filters, using the Pandas `describe()` method to get insight into key statistics for each column, using the Pandas `dtypes` property to inspect the data type of each column, and using Matplotlib and Seaborn to detect outliers and visualize relationships between features and labels. If you are working on a classification problem, use techniques you have learned to determine if there is class imbalance.\n",

Firstly, I want to deal with the null values as I see that there are five columns that contain many empty values. In the numeric columns, I will replace these null values with the mean for each column. Next, I notice there are many catergorical variable in this data set. I will want to perform one hot encoding on a few of these features since machine learning algorithms work best with numeric data. I will perform one-hot-encoding on the features workclass, sex_selfID, and occupation. Most importantly, my label is a string value with two options, \"<=50K\" or \">50K\", I will be changing this to a single binary column which our model can make predictions for. For the features I will be using, I am removing the education feature since its directly corrletaed with our feature education num, which is a better variable to have sicnce its numeric. Only numeric features will be used. I also performed winsorization on capital loss to cutoff outliers. The model I want to use will be a logistic regression since it works well for binary classification probleems. It also is good for interpretability. "
